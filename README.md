Given a sorted array of integers a,

find median/middle value.

**Example**

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be
solve(a) = 4.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6], the output should be
solve(a) = 4.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6, 6], the output should be
solve(a) = 7.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6, 6, 8], the output should be
solve(a) = 7.
